# Upgrading to v5

## `<Datagrid rowClick>` is no longer `false` by default

`<Datagrid>` will now make the rows clickable as soon as a Show or Edit view is declared on the resource (using the [resource definition](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/Resource.html)).

If you previously relied on the fact that the rows were not clickable by default, you now need to explicitly disable the `rowClick` feature:

```diff
-<Datagrid>
+<Datagrid rowClick={false}>
   ...
</Datagrid>
```
